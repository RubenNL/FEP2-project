  "data": "Well Hello There\nThe greeting message is often the first thing that people see on a website. These types of messages are especially popular on personal portfolios but can be found across all genres of sites. The typical strategy is to create a large, attractive and attention-grabbing headline, often mixed in with some sort of graphic.\n\nThe tone can be friendly, comical, serious, or even self-righteous. Remember that in writing this message, you’re making your first impression on your visitor about the personality of your company. Needless to say, you don’t want to screw it up!\n\nI’ve noticed several trends in how these messages are structured and have created a collection for you to browse through to find ideas for your own welcome message. It’s up to you to decide what you think will and won’t work with your visitors, but each of the categories below represents a tried and true method, usually structured to make visitors feel instantly welcome.\n\nHello\nWhat’s more friendly that a simple “hello”? This is probably the most common trend that I come across and is simply everywhere in designer portfolios these days. The idea is of course to make the site seem that much more alive and friendly, as if it’s a person welcoming you in. This is often effective when combined with a photo or illustration of the designer so it’s clear who the message is coming from."
