It\nstarted out as a port of [commonmark.js], but has since evolved into a\nfull library with a nice API and the following features:\n\n* Small (core has no dependencies, extensions in separate artifacts)\n* Fast (10-20 times faster than pegdown, see benchmarks in repo)\n* Flexible (manipulate the AST after parsing, customize HTML rendering)\n* Extensible (tables, strikethrough, autolinking and more, see below)\n\nThe library is supported on Java 8 and Java 9. It should work on Java 7\nand Android too, but that is on a best-effort basis, please report\nproblems. For Android the minimum API level is 15, see the\n[commonmark-android-test](commonmark-android-test) directory.\n\nCoordinates for core library (see all on [Maven Central]):\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>com.atlassian.commonmark</groupId>\n    <artifactId>commonmark</artifactId>\n    <version>0.15.2</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nThe module names to use in Java 9 are `org.commonmark`,\n`org.commonmark.ext.autolink`, etc, corresponding to package names.\n\nNote that for 0.x releases of this library, the API is not considered stable\nyet and may break between minor releases. After 1.0, [Semantic Versioning] will\nbe followed.\n\nSee the [spec.txt](commonmark-test-util/src/main/resources/spec.txt)\nfile if you're wondering which version of the spec is currently\nimplemented. Also check out the [CommonMark dingus] for getting familiar\nwith the syntax or trying out edge cases.\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n#### Parse and render to HTML"
